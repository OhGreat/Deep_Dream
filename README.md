
# Deep dream implementation with Tensorflow networks 
Deep Dream implementation and experimentation in tensorflow. This is still a work in progress.

## Requirements
<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>numpy >=1.19</li>
  <li>Tensorflow and CUDA</li>
</ul>

## Usage
#TODO: explain args
To run an experiment edit the bash script *experiment.sh* in the main directory and run it.

## Future Work
- Add more args for more detailed control<br/>
- Create bash script to run experiemnts.
